Not to mention, they are built for the bumpy and unpredictable ride! The metal loops that hold the Page Packs together are held snugly in place by magnets embedded in the Orbit’s backing. They are easy to pull out and swap packs, but strong enough to keep your pages safely secured. (Orbit pad not included. Pilot FriXion Pen and microfiber towel not included)\n\nWhen you write using any pen from the Pilot Frixion line, your writing sticks to Core pages like regular paper. But add a drop of water… and the notebook erases. Orbit pad sold separately.",

Although it feels like a traditional spiral notebook, the Core is an endlessly reusable digital spiral notebook, connected to all of your favorite cloud services.\nWhen you write using any pen from the Pilot Frixion line, your writing sticks to Core pages like regular paper. The Core is erasable, reusable, and eco-friendly. It also has the ability to connect to cloud services for storage and organization. In the market for a smart notebook?
